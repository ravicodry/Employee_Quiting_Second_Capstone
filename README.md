# Employee_LEAVING__JOB
**Problem Identification**
ZZZ company is facing an issue of human capital.They decide to check the status of each employee whether they will stay or leave the company.
So that they can plan further recruitment accordingly.
Secondly, company is investing so much time and money on hiring precess.They want to have some solution for this problem.


*Approach*:We have been provided the dataset of 1407 employees by the HR department. The dataset includes most of the factors which can account to predict whether an employee will stay or leave. Our approach is to find the most effective factors which create circumstances for an employee to leave the organization and based on these factors we can also predict the employee who can choose this path. We will use classification techniques to predict whether s/he will stay or leave.

**Findings**:

1-Customer Representative agents tend to leave compared to any other job.
2-Single employees tend to leave compared to married and divorced.
3-Less involved employees tend to leave the company.
4- experienced (low job level) tend to leave the company.
Idea for further Research: If we prioritize the employee according to the most critical job role in the organisation or skilled people and Job role which requires more time and effort to get hired.

**Recommendation**:
1- Required change in promotion policy of Customer Representative agents so that they can see their future in the same organisation.
2-Try to engage employees in extra curricular activity so that they have more attachment to the organisation.
3-Give new Joining better opportunities and Responsibilities.
4-Provide accommodation to staff nearby to  his/her station working.
